Rock-Paper-Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. The possible shapes are rock, paper, and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by the chosen shapes, with certain shapes defeating others (e.g., rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper).
The objective of this project is to develop a digital version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python programming language. The game should allow users to play against the computer and provide a graphical user interface for interaction.
The game is developed using object-oriented programming principles in Python. Classes are created for the game, player, and computer opponent, with methods for handling game actions and interactions. The graphical user interface is built using the Tkinter library to provide a user-friendly experience
Python programming language is used for development . Visual Studio Code is used for code editing and debugging . Tkinter library is utilized for creating the graphical user interface. Pillow library is utilized to show the images
